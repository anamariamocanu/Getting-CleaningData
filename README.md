# Getting-CleaningData

####This repository contains the following:
- run_analysis.R
- codebook.md
- tidy data txt file

####The "run_analysis.R" file contains the R code that can be used to achieve the following: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#####The codebook.md file describes the ouput file tidy data (tidydata.txt) andthe variables and transformations performed to clean up the original data
